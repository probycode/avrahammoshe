                Hello! I'm Avraham Moshe, a software engineer based in 
                Miami, FL.
                <br>
                <br>
                I enjoy creating things that live on the internet, whether
                be websites, applications, or anything in between.
                My goal is to always build products that provide pixel-
                perfect, performant experiences.
